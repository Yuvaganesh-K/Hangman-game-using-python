# Hangman-game-using-python
The file containing the words required for the game is uploaded as a text document. New words can be added to that text document.
Make sure that the project file and the text file(i.e.,wordlist) are in the same folder, so that python would be able to open the text file.
For the game to work in Colab, make sure that the text file is uploaded just before executing the game, and copy the path and paste it in place of 'wordlist.txt'.
